### 1.Why data mining
* Science
  data collected and stored at enormous speeds
  tarditional techniques infeeasible for raw data
  data mining helps scientists
* Industry

  often information "hidden" in the data that is not redily evident
  human analysts take weeks
  much data never analyzed at all
